// This program will calculate a student's GPA based on their
// grades so far. This particular student has attempted 18 credit 
// hours and has gotten 2 As, 2 Bs, a C, and an F.
// Letter grades translate into the following number of points:
// A = 4.0
// B = 3.0
// C = 2.0
// D = 1.0
// F = 0.0
// GPAs are calculated by dividing the number of points earned by
// the number of credit hours attempted
