// This program will calculate a student's GPA based on their
// grades so far. This particular student has attempted 18 credit 
// hours (3 credits per class) and has gotten 2 As, 2 Bs, a C, and an F.
// Letter grades translate into the following number of points:
//     A = 4.0
//     B = 3.0
//     C = 2.0
//     D = 1.0
//     F = 0.0
//
// Formula for calculating the number of points earned per grade:
//    (letter grade points) * number of credit hours attempted
//
// GPAs are calculated by dividing the total number of points earned by
// the number of credit hours attempted
